// The purpose of this exercise was to familiarize ourselves with the delay() feature in order to turn a light on and off.

// C++ code
//

int blinker = 8; 
int onDelay = 1000; // on time led
int offDelay = 1000; // off time led

void setup() {
pinMode(blinker, OUTPUT); // sets the blinker light as an output
}

void loop() {

  digitalWrite(blinker, 1);
  delay(1000); // Wait for 1 second before turning off
  digitalWrite(blinker, 0);
  delay(1000); // Wait for 1 second before turning back on
}
